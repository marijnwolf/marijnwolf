For the CIFAR, the network consists of 6 con2VD layers, with pooling and batchnormalization layers in between
Then is its flattend and 2 Dense layers are added,
the final Dense layer brings it down to the 10 different types of pictures. 
It is not extremely quick over 20 epochs but this was the only way i could achieve a validation accuracy of around 75%


For the gym: I get scores above 200 consistenly, computer keeps losing because he leaves the screen, dont know how to fix
